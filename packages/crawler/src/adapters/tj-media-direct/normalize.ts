 * Components are deduplicated by `normalizeForMatch` — two surface forms that
 * collapse to the same key produce a single component. Empty parts are

 *   'Charlie Puth(Feat.宇多田ヒカル)' -> ['Charlie Puth(Feat.宇多田ヒカル)', 'Charlie Puth', '宇多田ヒカル']
 *   'Charlie Puth(Feat.宇多田ヒカル) & Adele' -> ['Charlie Puth(Feat.宇多田ヒカル) & Adele', 'Charlie Puth', 'Adele', '宇多田ヒカル']
 *   'LE SSERAFIM(Prod.imase)' -> ['LE SSERAFIM(Prod.imase)', 'LE SSERAFIM', 'imase']
 *   'MAX(Feat.Huh Yunjin of LE SSERAFIM)' -> ['MAX(Feat.Huh Yunjin of LE SSERAFIM)', 'MAX', 'Huh Yunjin of LE SSERAFIM', 'Huh Yunjin', 'LE SSERAFIM']
 *   '安室奈美恵 with スーパーモンキーズ' -> ['安室奈美恵 with スーパーモンキーズ', '安室奈美恵', 'スーパーモンキーズ']
 *   'Artist1 × Artist2' -> ['Artist1 × Artist2', 'Artist1', 'Artist2']
 *   'YOASOBI' -> ['YOASOBI']
 *   'Bump of Chicken' -> ['Bump of Chicken']  (NOT split — bare ` of ` outside feat/prod)
 *   'Out of the Blue' -> ['Out of the Blue']  (NOT split — bare ` of ` outside feat/prod)

/**
 * Module-scope regexes for `splitArtistCollab`. Hoisted out of the function
 * body so they aren't recompiled on every call. Safe to share because none
 * carry per-call state: `FEAT_PAREN_RE` is `/g` but is consumed via
 * `.replace(re, fn)` which iterates the match list internally without leaking
 * `lastIndex` across calls; `SPLIT_RE` and `OF_RE` are non-`/g` and are used
 * with `.split` / `.test` which don't touch `lastIndex` either.
 *
 * Behaviour notes (preserved from the original in-function definitions):
 *
 *  - `FEAT_PAREN_RE` extracts every `(Feat. X)` / `(FEAT. X)` / `(Prod. X)`
 *    parenthetical from anywhere in the string (not just trailing). Mid-string
 *    cases like `Charlie Puth(Feat.宇多田ヒカル) & Adele` are handled, and
 *    `(Prod.X)` producer-credit syntax used by TJ (`LE SSERAFIM(Prod.imase)`)
 *    is structurally identical to `(Feat.X)` — the producer is a collab
 *    component for nationality-tag purposes.
 *
 *  - `SPLIT_RE` matches the primary delimiters (case-insensitive `i` covers
 *    FEAT. / With / WITH / meets):
 *      - `&` / `＆` (U+FF06 full-width — split runs before NFKC normalisation)
 *        / `,` / `×` / `｜` (U+FF5C full-width vertical bar) with optional
 *        surrounding whitespace
 *      - ` with ` (whitespace-delimited so it never bites mid-word)
 *      - ` meets ` (added 2026-05-04 for `CHiCO with HoneyWorks meets …`)
 *      - `feat.` (any case) with optional surrounding whitespace (catches the
 *        un-parenthesized form like `Artist1 FEAT. Artist2`)
 *
 *    Fix A.2 (2026-05-01): added `｜` (U+FF5C) to the delimiter set. The blog
 *    adapter convention for collab is `Artist1｜Artist2`; the legacy
 *    `primaryArtistToken` regex in `merge.ts` split on this character but
 *    `splitArtistCollab` did not, causing silent drift between the parser's
 *    admit rule and the merger's Tier C clustering. Required by Fix A.2's
 *    shared `getLeadComponent` helper to reproduce the canonical Tier C
 *    behavior (`椎名もた｜ぽわぽわP` → lead `椎名もた`).
 *
 *  - `OF_RE` is the ` of ` member-of-group sub-split, applied ONLY to text
 *    captured INSIDE a `(Feat. X)` / `(Prod. X)` parenthetical (Fix 1,
 *    2026-05-01). See the call site for full rationale.
